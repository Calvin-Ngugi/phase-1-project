# MY ANIME SITE
This site fetches anime from a public API and also has quite the interactivity with the user.
It is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

At every reload the site delivers a random anime to the page with its title in both English and Japanese, an image of the anime,
age rating, number of likes and a Youtube trailer if available

Explore this site and become part of the anime culture.

# Disclaimer
Some of the anime from the API do not have english titles or YouTube trailers
Therefore it might end up resorting to a type of error or reading as null.

There are some explicit content featured for all of you... men and women of culture ;)
